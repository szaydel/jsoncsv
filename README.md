# docker-jsoncsv

This repository is a Dockerfile for dockerizing a useful JSON to CSV converter utility, written in nodejs. It needs only a HTTP server to run, and built-in Python SimpleHTTPServer module is perfect for this. The actual project that this image uses is at: `https://github.com/konklone/json`.
